    "# AWS fleet predictive maintenance (Preview)\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS predictive maintenance solution for vehicle fleets (i.e., fleet predict) applies deep learning techniques to common areas that drive vehicle failures, unplanned downtime and repair costs.\n",
    "It serves as an initial building block for you to get a POC running within a single day.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution contains data preparation and visualization functionaility within Amazon SageMaker and allows you to train and optimize the hyperparameters of deep learning models for your dataset.\n",
    "You can use your own data or try the solution with a synthetic data set as part of this solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version processes vehicle sensor data over time. A subsequent version will process maintenance record data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "As part of the solution, the following services are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazon S3: Used to store datasets.\n",
    "* Amazon SageMaker Notebook: Used to preprocess and visualize the data, and to train the deep learning model.\n",
    "* Amazon SageMaker Endpoint: Used to deploy the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-fleet-predictive-maintenance/master/docs/architecture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An extract is created from the Fleet Management System containing vehicle data and sensor logs.\n",
    "2. **Amazon SageMaker model** is deployed after model is trained.\n",
    "3. Connected vehicle sends sensor logs to **AWS IoT Core** as shown (alternatively via HTTP interface).\n",
    "4. Sensor logs are persisted via **Amazon Kinesis**.\n",
    "5. Sensor logs are sent to **AWS Lambda** for analysis.\n",
    "6. **AWS Lambda** uses predictions model on sensor logs.\n",
    "7. Predictions are persisted in **Amazon S3**.\n",
    "8. Aggregate results are displayed on **Amazon QuickSight** dashboard.\n",
    "9. Real-time notifications are sent to **Amazon SNS**.\n",
    "10. **Amazon SNS** sends notifications back to connected vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stages\n",
    "Our solution is split into the following stages, and each stage has it's own notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduction: We take a high-level look at the solution components.\n",
    "* Data prepration: We prepare a dataset for machine learning.\n",
    "* Data visualization: We visualize the input data.\n",
    "* Model training: We train a model with Amazon SageMaker training jobs and Hyperparameter Optimization jobs.\n",
    "* Results analysis: We use Amazon SageMaker notebook to analyze the models trained and set up an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Config file\n",
    "The data preparation is defined by the config file located [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fleet-predictive-maintenance/sagemaker/config/config.yaml).\n",
    "The default configuration is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `fleet_info_fn=data/example_fleet_info.csv`\n",
    "* `fleet_sensor_logs_fn=data/example_fleet_sensor_logs.csv`\n",
    "* `vehicle_id_column=vehicle_id`\n",
    "* `timestamp_column=timestamp`\n",
    "* `target_column=target`\n",
    "* `period_ms=30000`\n",
    "* `dataset_size=10000`\n",
    "* `window_length=20`\n",
    "* `chunksize=10000`\n",
    "* `processing_chunksize=1000`\n",
    "* `fleet_dataset_fn=data/processed/fleet_dataset.csv`\n",
    "* `train_dataset_fn=data/processed/train_dataset.csv`\n",
    "* `test_dataset_fn=data/processed/test_dataset.csv`\n",
    "* `period_column=period_ms`\n",
    "\n",
    "`fleet_info_fn`, `fleet_sensor_logs_fn`, `fleet_dataset_fn`, `train_dataset_fn`, `test_dataset_fn` defines the location of dataset files.\n",
    "\n",
    "`vehicle_id_column`, `timestamp_column`, `target_column`, and `period_column` defines the headers for columns\n",
    "\n",
    "`dataset_size`, `chunksize`, `processing_chunksize`, `period_ms`, and `window_length` defines properties of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Stage\n",
    "Up next we'll take a look at [preparing datasets for machine learning](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fleet-predictive-maintenance/blob/master/sagemaker/2_data_preparation.ipynb).\n"
